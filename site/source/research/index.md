Anyone wishing to complete authentic research is eligible to
use the DRO facilities. Evidence that the research is genuine
must be provided by supplying adequate detail about the proposed
project through the
[Research Application Form](../forms-and-procedures/#research-application).
This is submitted to the DROâ€™s Research Committee for approval
and must be lodged at least 6 weeks prior to commencement.

Research is coordinated under four main themes:

* Canopy-Atmosphere Interactions
* Biodiversity
* Ecological Process
* Physiological processes

### Ensuring the ecological integrity of the site

An important objective in managing the DRO is to ensure that
research and other activities do not compromise the ecological
integrity of the site. The main strategy used in meeting this
objective is a critical review of research proposals in which
potential ecological impacts are evaluated. Researchers should
therefore keep this in mind when submitting research proposals.

Ecological impacts of several forms are of concern in this
context. These include:

* activities which involve the removal of plants, plant parts, animals and other materials from the site
* activities with the potential to disrupt important ecological processes
* activities which might preclude subsequent studies or interfere with current studies on the site

In exceptional circumstances, the scientific review committee
which examines research proposals may ask a research applicant
to redesign their project to avoid some of these ecological
impacts.

### Ensuring high quality research outcomes

Another major objective of the DRO is to maximise the quality
of the research on the site and the resulting publications.
As a general rule, the research must have the capacity to
contribute towards a scientific publication or a postgraduate
thesis, or it must be a requirement of an undergraduate course.

One step in achieving this objective is a review process for
research proposals. Members of a scientific review committee
are drawn from senior academic staff at James Cook University.
This review committee is asked to assess whether or not the
results of a proposed project might reasonably be expected
to warrant publication. Members of the committee may
subsequently suggest improvements in research design to
some applicants.

Another important means of enhancing the quality of research
outcomes from the facility is to encourage collaboration and
cooperation between researchers.

### Data available for researchers

##### Climate data

TODO: fill out SOME-YEAR in following paragraph

Weather data has been collected since SOME-YEAR on the station
with some interruptions at two sites: the clearing adjacent
to the rainforest, and above the forest canopy on the tower
of the crane. This data includes wind velocity and direction,
rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity and solar
radiation, and can be made available through collaboration
with Dr Michael Liddell.

##### Flora

TODO: check years are correct below

Within the arc of the crane, all trees which have a DBH
(Diameter at Breast Height) greater than 10cm have been
identified and tagged. This encompasses a total of 680 trees,
comprised of 33 different families and 82 species. A map
illustrating the location of each of these trees was created
using polar co-ordinates by Martin Freiberg in 2002 and was
updated in 2009. The map includes the position of the trees,
their height and crown diameter. A DBH census is completed
every 5 years on the plot. For a detailed tree species list
including the abundance of each species and DBH data please
contact the research station directly.

TODO: include other sensor data

### Funding

The DRO offers student research grants to Honours, Masters
and PhD students enrolled at Australian and international
universities. Please visit the [Grants](../grants)
page for detailed information.

### Fees and Charges

The station must charge
[bench fees](../forms-and-procdures/#fee-schedule) to meet
its operating costs. University students and JCU researchers
receive subsidised rates. The bench fee includes accommodation,
use of the communal kitchen and the laboratory.  Separate fees
apply for the use of the crane.

TODO: It looks like there's different fees for 'everything' and
'everything-except-the-crane'.  If that's true the previous
paragraph's language needs tweaking.

### Policies and Procedures

Researchers are required to be familiar with and observe all
applicable Federal and State regulations as well as DRO and
James Cook University policies and procedures. It is the
responsibility of researchers to inform themselves of these;
DRO and JCU policies are
[available on the web](../forms-and-procedures) and at the
station.

Non-adherence to these policies may result in levies
incurred for cleaning, disposal of material, damage, loss or
theft of station property.

Researchers should also familiarize themselves with the
[General Information Package](../forms-and-procedures/#general-info)
and the
[Safety Briefing Notes](../forms-and-procedures/#safety-briefing-notes)
before their arrival on site.

this page has two parts: showcasing research done, and bringing in future research.

content describes completed, ongoing, and planned research and info for doing future research, e.g. http://www.jcu.edu.au/canopycrane/informationfor/JCUPRD_046932.html

also cover how great it would be to come do your research here.

links to Observatory>Facilities page.

Child pages cover all the things researchers need to know / do to visit the DRO.

This is the entry path for recruiting new research clients, so the sub-pages under here should be reviewed by scientist(s) representative of potential DRO clients.

Q: Booking-a-visit page covers actually making contact; what other sub pages should exist here?
