The Daintree Rainforest Observatory is situated in a remote
area (hospital services are over 1 hour away), so safety is
paramount. Consequently, staff at the DRO are highly trained
in several safety qualifications including the following:

* Workplace Health and Safety
* Advanced First Aid and Advanced Resuscitation
* Vertical Rope Rescue/Working at Heights
* Risk Management
* Fire Warden

The Site Safety Plan incorporates the use of various types of
safety equipment which all staff are trained to use. This
consists of two-way radios, a satellite phone, abseiling and
recovery equipment, an Emergency Personal Locator Beacon
(EPLB) for life-threatening emergencies, an AED
(Automated External Defibrillator) and an Oxygen Resuscitation
Kit.

All clients are fully briefed on safety issues before entering
the site and all safety equipment is regularly inspected by
DRO personnel. Our height safety equipment (including harnesses
and lanyards) is officially inspected every 6 months by an
accredited lifting, rigging and height safety provider.

All visitors will be asked to disclose any pre-existing medical
conditions to the staff. This information is confidential and
is requested solely for each individuals own safety.

For more detailed information on the safety procedures and
hazards for the DRO please refer to the Safety Briefing Notes.
