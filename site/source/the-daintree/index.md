### Location

The Daintree Rainforest Observatory is located at 40m (~130ft)
elevation in lowland tropical rainforest at Cape Tribulation,
140 kilometres (~87 miles) north of Cairns in Queensland
Australia (16&deg; 06' 14.8" S,
145&deg; 26' 58.0" E). The site is adjacent to the Daintree
National Park. The Daintree rainforest has the highest
biodiversity anywhere in Australia and has a unique Gondwanan flora.

In 1988 the rainforests among which the crane is situated were
declared the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. This is one of the
few areas in the world where the reef meets the rainforest, and the
only place where two World Heritage Areas sit side by side. The
site is flanked to the west by coastal ranges rising to more than
1400m (~4600ft) and by the Coral Sea to the east.

### Climate

Annual average rainfall is approximately 3500mm (~137in) and is
strongly seasonal with 70% falling during the wet season which
runs from December to April. Summers are often hot and humid with
the mean daily temperature in January around 28°C / 82°F. However,
temperatures up to 36°C / 97°F are not unusual during the summer
months. Winters are mild and dry with the mean daily temperature
in July around 22°C / 72°F.

Northern Australia is subject to tropical cyclones in the wet
season and their occurrence is unpredictable. The impact of these
severe tropical storm systems are regarded as a natural phenomenon
and a key evolutionary factor in shaping the ecology of
Queensland's tropical lowland rainforests.

### History

The area in which this site is located was selectively logged in
the late 1950s and early 1960s. There are however standing
specimens of Toona ciliata (Red Cedar) in the area, which suggests
that this logging was probably not intensive.

Extreme disturbance due to storm damage (tropical cyclones) is
common in the area on a cycle of approximately 50 years. On the
11th of February 1999, tropical cyclone Rona (category 3) passed
over the Cape Tribulation area causing widespread major damage.
Wind gusts of up to 170km/hr (~105mph), local flooding and storm
surges of up to 1.4m (~4ft 7in) were recorded in the area. The
canopy crane site was severely damaged, as approximately 10% of
the trees were felled and 50% of the trees suffered complete
crown loss on the research plot. The past 10 years has shown
profound recovery of the forest.

### Flora

The vegetation at the Daintree Rainforest Observatory is complex
mesophyll vine forest. There are a large range of botanical
structural features represented including buttress and spur
roots, a tall but irregular canopy with indistinct stratification
of sub-canopy (saplings/seedlings/ground cover layers) and
irregular stem diameters. There are a variety of robust woody
lianas, vascular epiphytes, palms (both feather and fan),
zingibers and aroids prominent on the site. The canopy is
irregular, varying from 25 to 40 metres (82 to 131 feet), with
dominant canopy trees belonging to the Proteaceae, Meliaceae,
Sapindaceae, Apocynaceae, Lauraceae and Myrtaceae families.

### Fauna

The surrounding forests support around eight hundred species
of vertebrates, a number of which are endemic. Mammals observed
on the site include Bennett’s tree-kangaroo,
prehensile-tailed rat, long-tailed pygmy possum, striped possum,
giant white-tailed rat, Cape York and bush rats,
fawn-footed Melomys, long-nosed bandicoot and a variety of bats.
A wide range of birds including several dove species,
five species of honeyeaters, Victoria's riflebird,
orange-footed scrubfowl, spotted catbirds, lesser sooty owls,
ospreys, grey and brown goshawks and parrots have been recorded
at the site. Also present on site are several frog species and
reptiles including Boyd's forest dragon, eastern water dragon,
carpet and amethystine pythons and two colubrid snakes.

Use words like “unique” a few times.

Goal of this page is to help potential researchers work out if this location has what they want, and potential high school attendees work out if this is interesting enough / nice enough to visit.

Ideally one photo on this page shows the golf course with someone swinging a club.  No need to mention it in the text..

q | should this page include tips about planning for local conditions, e.g. temperatures across the day, biting insects, what shoes to wear?  Maybe that’s a sub-page called “Planning a visit” or something similar?  Or, should that stuff be under the Research and Education pages.
