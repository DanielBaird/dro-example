general page to catch people who arenâ€™t researchers or educators, but want to visit, e.g. conference & special interest groups, tourists, etc.

Content similar to http://www.jcu.edu.au/canopycrane/informationfor/JCUPRD_046930.html

mostly just links to the Research>Book-a-visit page and the Schools>Book-a-visit pages.  What else do we need for conference visitors or other groups?

Q: Should this page also collect the safety and other forms and procedures that are common to research, school, and other visitors?
