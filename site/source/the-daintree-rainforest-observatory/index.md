JCU’s Daintree Rainforest Observatory is one of only five long-term
ecological monitoring sites in Australia.

The Observatory caters to researchers and educators with residential
facilities and two laboratories onsite.

An open-air teaching lab is suitable for group sessions, and a
traditional, air-conditioned laboratory is equipped to support the
basic needs of most rainforest research.

The Observatory also has a [Canopy Crane](../canopy-crane), which allows researchers
to explore the rainforest, from the atmosphere above the canopy down
through its different levels, and the rainforest site includes many
data collection instruments to examine sap flow, soil condition and
many other features.

contains a paragraph or two plus photos describing the utility of the DRO for the two themes, FW Research and Education Experience.

Ideas for photos:
- the on-site facilities, illustrating that the site is capable of accommodating groups in a civilised way
- someone in the crane gondola doing something, illustrating the type of fieldwork only a crane can allow
- people, ideally young people, walking on a track or something, illustrating that there’s stuff for high school kids to do
- a sensor like a dendrometer, illustrating continual data collection
- a drought experiment sail, illustrating experiments can be large in scale

One of the photos on this page should have a big expansive view of the broader setting.

Include in-content links to all the major pages.

The footer used everywhere (see below) will include links to all major and minor pages (and possibly is actually a sort of sitemap with links to every subpage as well).
