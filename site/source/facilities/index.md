### Accommodation

Following a recent redevelopment, the DRO can accommodate up
to 46 researchers, students or visitors in shared accommodation.
Researcher accommodation consists of two triple share rooms with
attached kitchen and bathroom.

TODO: pic(s) of researcher accommodation.  Maybe just a single
horizontal strip of two or three small pics, that link to the
relevant section of the
[Photo Tour](../facilities-photo-tour) page.

Dormitory accommodation is provided for groups of up to 40
people in four- and six-bed rooms. These have access to a
communal kitchen and amenities block nearby. Also available to
all visitors is a BBQ deck and laundry facilities. Laundry
facilities are provided for all visitors in the amenities
block.

TODO: pic(s) of dorm accommodation.  Maybe just a single
horizontal strip of two or three small pics, that link to the
relevant section of the
[Photo Tour](../facilities-photo-tour) page.

TODO: describe pathways w.r.t. wheelchairs and whatnot

Wi-Fi is available in each building and three computers are
accessible for visitor use in the office. A reference
collection of books and papers is also available in the
office for visitors to peruse.

The site manager and crane operator also reside permanently
on site, in a separate residence.

### Laboratories and teaching areas

Two laboratories are now available for visitor use. The first
is a teaching lab, consisting of benches in an open-walled,
undercover area. This is suitable for groups or individuals
bringing samples from the forest as it can be hosed clean.
It contains storage areas, ceiling fans, lighting, large sinks
and a drying oven.

[Photo Tour](../facilities-photo-tour) page.

The second laboratory is the wet lab. This is constantly
air-conditioned and contains flammables and corrosives storage
cabinets, fume cupboard, microscopes (light and dissecting) and
microscope bench and other sensitive scientific equipment. It
also houses plant, fungi and insect collections for visitor
reference.

[Photo Tour](../facilities-photo-tour) page.

For researchers wishing to access a sterile laboratory, access
can be arranged at the Cairns JCU campus.

### Covered work areas in the forest

The sheds in the forest have recently been upgraded. One is an
open shed with electricity, work benches and overhead lighting.
This is available for visitors to carry out work while in the
forest but is not for the long-term storage of equipment.

TODO: a small pic of each shed that links to the relevant
section of the [Photo Tour](../facilities-photo-tour) page.

The other shed is fully enclosed and also has electricity,
benches and lighting. This contains sensitive electrical
equipment required to run data loggers and other equipment in
the forest. It can be used as a work space if additional space
is required and has limited space for the storage of equipment
for returning researchers.
