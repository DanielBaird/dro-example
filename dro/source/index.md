contains a paragraph or two plus photos describing the utility of the DRO for the two themes, FW Research and Education Experience.

Ideas for photos:
- the on-site facilities, illustrating that the site is capable of accommodating groups in a civilised way
- someone in the crane gondola doing something, illustrating the type of fieldwork only a crane can allow
- people, ideally young people, walking on a track or something, illustrating that thereâ€™s stuff for high school kids to do
- a sensor like a dendrometer, illustrating continual data collection
- a drought experiment sail, illustrating experiments can be large in scale

One of the photos on this page should have a big expansive view of the broader setting.

Include in-content links to all the major pages.

The footer used everywhere will include links to all major and minor pages (and possibly is actually a sort of sitemap with links to every subpage as well).
