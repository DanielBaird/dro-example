content describes the rainforest and surrounding landscape, flora & fauna, etc; e.g. content from:

http://www.jcu.edu.au/canopycrane/about/JCUPRD_046915.html

http://www.jcu.edu.au/canopycrane/about/JCUPRD_046919.html

Include a Google maps link to the crane (maybe a Bing Maps link too, etc)

Use words like “unique” a few times.

Goal of this page is to help potential researchers work out if this location has what they want, and potential high school attendees work out if this is interesting enough / nice enough to visit.

Ideally one photo on this page shows the golf course with someone swinging a club.  No need to mention it in the text..

q | should this page include tips about planning for local conditions, e.g. temperatures across the day, biting insects, what shoes to wear?  Maybe that’s a sub-page called “Planning a visit” or something similar?  Or, should that stuff be under the Research and Education pages.
