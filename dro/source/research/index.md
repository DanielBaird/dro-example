this page has two parts: showcasing research done, and bringing in future research.

content describes completed, ongoing, and planned research and info for doing future research, e.g. http://www.jcu.edu.au/canopycrane/informationfor/JCUPRD_046932.html

also cover how great it would be to come do your research here.

links to Observatory>Facilities page.

Child pages cover all the things researchers need to know / do to visit the DRO.

This is the entry path for recruiting new research clients, so the sub-pages under here should be reviewed by scientist(s) representative of potential DRO clients.

Q: Booking-a-visit page covers actually making contact; what other sub pages should exist here?
